# What I Used To Build This Application?

- Java
- Spring Boot
- Thymeleaf
- Bootstrap

# Features

- Creating and deleting company
- Adding and removing employee from company

# Reflections

- Small and stupid project to learn basic of spring boot.

- I don't like having template engine in my project such as Thymeleaf I would prefer to have backend decoupled from frontend and just communicate throught REST API, so my next project is gonna be like that
